<p>  I was born and raised in the Bay area and moving to Eugene was a huge difference. Back home everything was extremely fast paced and I enjoyed it. The transition to an extremely relaxed environment was hard.</p>

<p> I have often been told that getting involved in a CIT minor was going to be too difficult for me. Yes this does not come as easy as drawing or baking, but I want to work at this and better my skills in this field. I was tired of being told I couldn't do it.</p>

<p> Growing up I fricking loved watermelon. I was never too sure if it was the visual appeal of the fruit or the watery fruity flavor.  "Down by the Bayy, where the watermelons growww..." 
     this was always my favorite line to sing, the idea made my smile as big as the watermelon slice.</p>
